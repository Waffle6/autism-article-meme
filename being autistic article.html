<strong>Step One: Realize Your autistic!!</strong>
<p> To realize you're autistic, ask yourself this; Shiddy tiddie dumb dumb. Did you laugh? Yes? your autistic. </p>
<br>
<strong>Step two: actualize! </strong>
<p>Now that you're autistic, you should look the part. Buy shirts with video game characters from your local walmart. Wear glasses.
Even if you don't need them, just wear ones without lenses. You need to look like someone who looks at their screen all day. maybe get a pimple or two, that doesn't matter as much.</p>
<br>
<strong> Step three: act the part!!!</strong>
<p> Okay, you've made it this far. And luckily for your autistic self this is the final and must important part.
Here is a list of activities that will make you look like a spasming weasel that needs to be put down
for the safety of those around him. HIM, as female autists dont exist.
<br>
<ul><li>Dont move your neck first when you look around. Look with your eyes.</li><li> Squint your eyes when you look somewhat even close to the direction of the sun,
as computer screens has fried your retinas.</li><li> When you walk, look straight ahead. This ties into looking with your eyes first. When you turn a corner, you turn your neck preemptively.</li><li>
keep your body tenses at all times, only moving your limbs when you do an action.</li><li> If you do move your body when you're not doing something like opening a door, like walking, make it look stiff.
You need to look like you're out of your element.</ul>
<br>
<p> While there's much more I could have touched on, this will give you a boost to your new Autism filled life. I wish you a happy may the 4th, fellow padawons (star wars reference, for those who might not know of it!!)</p>
<p><em>Adios!</em></p>
